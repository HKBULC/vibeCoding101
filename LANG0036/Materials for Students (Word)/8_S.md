THE JOB-HUNTING EXPERIENCE OF ETHNIC MINORITIES

# Task 2 – Stories of Ethnic Minorities in Hong Kong

# Read the passage below about three ethnic minority individuals living in Hong Kong and complete the 2 speaking activities below:

# Arista Devi

# Arista Devi, a 29-year-old woman of Indonesian descent, moved to Hong Kong at the age of 10 with her family. Growing up in a predominantly Chinese community, she faced challenges adapting to the local culture, particularly due to language barriers. Despite this, Arista excelled academically and pursued a degree in social work at a local university. She now works as a community organizer, advocating for better support services for ethnic minority youth. Arista is passionate about breaking stereotypes and often speaks at events to share her experiences, emphasizing the importance of cultural integration while maintaining her Indonesian heritage. She describes herself as resilient, empathetic, and determined.

# Kawaljot Kaur

# Kawaljot Kaur, a 25-year-old Hong Kong-born Sikh woman, has lived in the city her entire life. As a child, she attended a local school where she was often the only Sikh student, which led to feelings of isolation. However, her parents encouraged her to embrace both her Sikh identity and Hong Kong culture, teaching her Punjabi at home while she learned Cantonese at school. Kawaljot now works as a graphic designer and runs a small business creating culturally inspired artwork. Her passion lies in promoting diversity through art, and she has organized exhibitions to showcase the contributions of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. She considers herself creative, optimistic, and proud.

# Michael Cheung

# Michael Cheung, a 32-year-old man of mixed Filipino and British descent, was born in the Philippines but moved to Hong Kong at age 15. He initially struggled with discrimination, particularly when applying for jobs, as many employers assumed he couldn’t speak Cantonese fluently despite his proficiency. Michael eventually found a role as a teacher in an international school, where he now educates students about cultural diversity. He is an avid photographer and uses his hobby to document the lives of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, hoping to raise awareness about their challenges. Michael describes himself as reflective, adventurous, and compassionate.

Transcript

My name is Yusuf, and I am 20 years old. I study the University of Hong Kong, and I am both a Hong Konger and a South Indian because these are two of my most important identities. My family came to Hong Kong through my grandfather. He came in the 70s and he worked as a journalist in Hong Kong for the Star Company. This was also during the time when Hong Kong needed more workers and this was during the industrial boom, so he came in the 70s and then I was born and my sister was born here, so we’re both first generation Hong Kongers.

When I consider if I’m a Hong Kong or Indian, it definitely is a dilemma. I’m always either one or the other sometimes to the people, but I’m both at the same time, which is why every time I go back to India it’s a very confusing thing because when I go back I miss Hong Kong, but then when I’m in Hong Kong I also miss India because it’s two different worlds, and once you have to choose one or the other it doesn’t work that way.

In terms of friends, most of my friends I wouldn’t say that it’s only Chinese or only ethnic minorities. I have friends from all over the world. It’s very international because the school I also went to for secondary was an international school, so most of the people there were from many different countries, not just ethnic minority countries or Hong Kong. I really like HKU because I feel I get to explore beyond certain boundaries. For example, in secondary school, even though I really liked my secondary school, it was very limiting in terms of the people there, in terms of the education system, because the education system is very limiting, because I did Hong Kong DSE, and since I don’t know Cantonese I had to do the French curriculum, which was easier for me, but at the same time the Hong Kong curriculum doesn’t prepare you for Chinese, for example.

In kindergarten, because I didn’t speak Cantonese, they would reject me from kindergarten school, so I would always have to go to English schools, and even in English schools they don’t teach Cantonese fluently. It’s very basic level Cantonese, so all my Cantonese that I know is very, very basic, and because of that I don’t end up learning complex language or interaction based language, and these are the language that’s very important in society, but since we don’t have that here and since it’s not being taught properly, it’s very limiting, but it’s a very common phenomenon for ethnic minorities who go to English-based schools or EMI schools.

At HKU, I feel the opportunities are endless in terms of research, in terms of internship, in terms of just a lot of things, and it’s just beyond academics. It’s more than just studying all day. A lot of my art is based on what inspires me, so for example, this artwork is Rose from Titanic, and then this one is a famous artist did this paintball. It’s something referring to Satan, but the fallen angel painting, and then this is done with watercolor, and this is Cleopatra the Egyptian queen, and then this is another one. It’s another recreation piece. It’s another famous recreation that I’ve done.

I will stay in Hong Kong depending on the circumstances, but if I have the opportunity to go abroad, then of course I will take that opportunity, especially if it’s for research or educational purposes, because I don’t think that limiting yourself to one country or one place is good for you. You should always keep traveling, keep learning new things from other people, so that it broadens your own perspectives, your own scope of living.

# Task 4 – Chinese language requirements in the Hong Kong job market

# To encourage employers to accommodate non-Chinese speaking employees in the workplace, this article by Hong Kong Unison (2016) provides a few policy suggestions. Read its details and answer the reading comprehension questions below:

# Comprehension questions:

3.	 ADVOCATING FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION

# Task 5 – Advocacy Practice

Watch the following video about the positive and negative experiences of people of ethnic minority living in Hong Kong.

What can ordinary citizens do to help improve social inclusion of ethnic minorities?

In groups, write an advocacy champion slogan addressed to relevant stakeholders involved. Use parallel structure and begin each line with the addressee, followed by “…, let us …, no matter…., never mind…..”. The first two lines are provided as an example:

Homeowners, let us open our doors to renters from near and far,

No matter what color their skin is, never mind who they are.

Bank officers, let us ____________________,

No matter ____________________, never mind ________________.

Shopkeepers, let us __________________________,

No matter ________________, never mind ________________;

Restaurant owners, let us ________________,

No matter ________________, never mind ________________.

Together we make Hong Kong a truly inclusive city,

No matter where you're from, never mind your identity.

# Task 6 – Express your views on social inclusion in Hong Kong

# Some people believe that ethnic minorities face significant barriers to social inclusion in cities like Hong Kong, while others argue that these challenges can be overcome with community efforts. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the view that community efforts can improve social inclusion for ethnic minorities?

# Write up your views in 250-300 words. Use examples from the videos and materials you have studied in this module to support your argument.

# Writing tips:

# State your opinion clearly in the introduction;

# Provide reasons and examples to support your view in the main body paragraphs;

# Include a conclusion summarising your position.

8. Policy Suggestions 
Labour Department 
8.1. The Labour Department should develop an employment programme for ethnic minorities with reference to the “Employment Programme for the Middle-aged” and other similar measures. The programme should provide adequate support to ethnic minority job seekers to overcome language barriers and other difficulties, and provide encouragement and incentives for employers to hire ethnic minorities. The Labour Department should initiate such project at the department and be a role model to other employers. 

8.2. The Labour Department should raise the awareness of employers on whether the job really requires Chinese proficiency when posting the vacancies. Employers should be reminded that they must be able to justify any language requirement or condition by showing that it is relevant to and not more demanding than what is required for doing the job as an unjustifiable requirement can lead to claims of indirect discrimination. 

Adult Chinese language classes 
8.3. The government should enhance its efforts in providing accredited adult Chinese classes to residents who need them. Although some organizations (including the Employees Retraining Board, HAD-funded support service centres for ethnic minorities, and tertiary institutions) operate government-funded Chinese language classes, there is a lack of coordination between these courses. Classes provided by community centres are mostly beginners’ level, and the lack of coordination makes it difficult for learners to progress to advanced classes in other institutions. There are also few Cantonese-based Chinese classes in the private market. 

Chinese language learning in post-secondary education 
8.4. The Education Bureau should encourage and support post-secondary education institutions to provide appropriate Chinese language learning opportunities to students to whom Chinese is a second language, in order to increase their competitiveness for the job market after graduation (bridge GCSE/GCE level to higher proficiency). 

Chinese language education for second-language learners 
8.5. Many ethnic minority residents graduated from the public education system are without adequate Chinese language skills because there has not been an effective Chinese as a second language policy. The government should implement an effective Chinese as a Second Language policy that includes appropriate curriculum, teaching materials, learning objectives, assessment tools and teacher training in order to help ethnic minority students access the full range of employment opportunities. The government should also study the level of Chinese needed to allow full access to economic opportunities and community life in Hong Kong and design the Chinese-language curriculum accordingly.
