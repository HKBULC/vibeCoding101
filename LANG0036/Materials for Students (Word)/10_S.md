This video is about communication styles and how culture influences them. One of the key differences across cultures was conceptualised by Edward Hall as low-context communication and high-context communication, which are not separate categories but the ends of a continuum. Now, even though nation does not equal culture, there are some tendencies that can be observed at very low-context, low, median, high, and very high.

In low-context cultures, good communication is direct, explicit, precise, and detailed. In these situations, silence is considered negatively as a sign of ignorance or lack of interest, which makes low-context communicators feel uncomfortable. They also give more importance to facts, tasks, and ideas than to people and relationships. As a result, criticising an idea is common and not seen as criticising the person. In other words, open debate and disagreement are part of normal low-context conversation.

In high-context cultures, good communication is indirect, implicit, and suggestive because high-context communicators consider that there is enough obvious information in the situation, there is no need to say a lot. So, high-context communication is more about clues and suggestions, which the listener has to understand. Now, for them, silence is seen as a positive, showing thoughtfulness and respect. They also consider personal relationships to be more important than ideas or right or wrong, so criticising an idea is seen as criticising the person who expressed it. As a result, open debate and disagreement are usually avoided.

Here’s an example in an office situation where an important meeting has been confirmed first with a boss and her assistant as low-context communicators. In this case, the conversation may go as follows. … Even though this is what the assistant does every time there is an important meeting, his boss gives him all the details every time. Now, with high-context communicators, the boss would simply confirm the meeting in a few words, which would be enough to suggest to the assistant that he needs to get the conference room ready, gets refreshments, and do everything else that he needs to do in this situation.

So, remember, low-context communication is direct, detailed, avoids silence, is comfortable with debate and disagreement, and is idea- and task-oriented. High-context communication is indirect, suggestive, welcomes and uses silence, avoids debate and disagreement, and is more relationship-oriented. And people may move on this continuum based on their personality or how familiar they are with each other.

When it comes to non-verbal communication, there are also major differences, especially with gestures, personal space, facial expressions, and eye contact. Using one’s hands and arms in conversation is seen differently across cultures, some considering a lot of gestures as normal, others avoiding them as much as possible. This is even more complex when you know that the same gestures may have different meanings in different cultures. For personal space, the comfortable distances of interaction are determined by the size of one’s intimate space, personal space, and public space, which can change considerably based on culture or personal preferences.

What one shows on one’s face is also determined by culture, especially when frowning, smiling, or showing emotion. Smiling is a good example. In most Asian cultures, smiling in embarrassing or difficult situations is normal, but in many other cultures, this may seem strange and even rude. Eye contact is another key aspect of non-verbal communication with differences across cultures. Some, as in North America, Spain, Italy, and France, consider looking someone in the eye as normal, honest, and respectful during communication, so a lack of eye contact is understood as a lack of honesty, interest, or respect. Conversely, other cultures consider strong eye contact to be aggressive and rude. Low eye contact or only very brief eye contact is therefore the norm. Low eye contact cultures include Asian cultures, for instance, and norms can change based on gender. All of the norms defining these aspects of communication are part of each person’s identity and frame of reference and are therefore central to communication across cultures. …

Task 3 – Reflections on your own intercultural experiences

Part 1: Individual Reflection (4–5 minutes)
Reflect on the following questions about intercultural interactions in your daily life. Try to speak for 1-2 minutes per question, providing examples where possible.

Have you ever interacted with someone from another culture? When and where did this happen?

Are you often aware of cultural differences when you communicate with people from other countries?

How often do you meet people from different cultures in your city?

Part 2: Individual Long Turn (3–4 minutes)
You will have 1 minute to prepare your response, then speak for 1–2 minutes on the topic below. Use the prompts to guide your answer, and try to speak continuously without long pauses.

Describe a time when you interacted with someone from another culture.

You may consider:

When and where this interaction took place, and why it happened.

Who you interacted with (e.g., a friend, colleague, or stranger).

Whether you encountered any difficulties during the interaction, and how you handled them.

What you could have done differently to improve the interaction.

Part 3: Follow-Up Discussion (4–5 minutes)
Discuss the following questions in your group, providing detailed responses and examples. These questions require you to analyse broader implications of intercultural communication. Aim to speak for 1–2 minutes per question.

Why do you think some people find it difficult to communicate with individuals from other cultures?

How can understanding cultural differences improve communication in a globalised world?

What role does education play in promoting effective intercultural communication?

## 2. Solutions and advocacy

Task 4 - Intercultural dialogue

Let’s watch a video to learn more about intercultural dialogue. While watching the video, answer the questions below:

UNESCO: What does Intercultural Dialogue mean? https://youtu.be/Hik4YcyxWs0?si=jI2whWmXyhkO44XE

Transcript

Humanity is facing growing challenges of inequality, forced displacement, xenophobia, and violent extremism. To change this, we need to talk to each other. Methods promoting respect, empathy, and acceptance of others can help us value cultural differences. This is what intercultural dialogue does. It helps us better understand others and accept diverse views. This makes it easier to build meaningful communication channels open to change.

Intercultural dialogue can lead to mindset shifts and mobilisation to act against root causes and violence worldwide. You can do it everywhere — in education, it fosters social awareness, skills, increases interaction between different cultures. In the media, it stimulates debate between different groups and better representation. In culture and arts, it creates awareness, learning opportunities, and reflection. In local governance, it helps to build inclusive public spaces, activities, and networks. In political negotiation, it facilitates and stimulates dialogue to reach mediation and agreement. Intercultural dialogue is the basis for a stable and inclusive environment. Help us spread the word that we need to talk. To support you, we at UNESCO propose an e-platform, free educational resources, and tools. …

## 3. Intercultural communication competence

Task 5 - Crucial personal competencies for intercultural communication

There are a variety of skills that are necessary for effective intercultural communication; some of them may be taught, while others are inherent and just require practice. Let’s take a look at some of the most crucial personal competencies for intercultural communication, as opposed to just linguistic ones like speaking, listening, and body language.

Self-awareness: Recognising how your personal views, behaviours, and possible prejudices and stereotypes might affect a conversation is a massive step in improving your ability to have meaningful interactions with others.

Empathy: Intercultural communication relies heavily on empathizing with others and gaining insight into their experiences.

Respect: Even if you don’t agree with or appreciate every aspect of another person’s or group’s culture, you may still respect them by recognizing their right to do so.

Emotional intelligence: Learning to pick up on the subtleties of communication is essential when working with people from other cultures. Whether you get what is being communicated or not depends on how well you use your senses, how well you know yourself, and how well you can empathize with others.

Adaptability: One of the goals of intercultural communication is to teach people how to modify their way of speaking to replace ambiguity, conflict, and antagonism with clarity, harmony, and cooperation. That’s why it’s important to be adaptable in our thinking, reactions, and interactions with others, as well as in our speech, listening, and body language.

Patience: Effective communication across cultural boundaries doesn’t happen immediately. That’s why you need to have patience. Don’t rush through the process of becoming well-versed in best practices; instead, take your time and make them part of your routine. Due to cultural differences, it may take more or less time than usual to absorb new information.

Positivity: Maintaining an optimistic attitude when interacting with people of other cultures is crucial. Misunderstandings occur all the time, and in most cases, it’s not because someone was trying to be deliberately unclear. Those of us who aren’t well-versed in other cultures often fail to grasp the intended meaning of a message. This is why it’s essential to look at every intercultural exchange in a constructive light.

Based on the intercultural communication competencies listed above, answer the following questions:

Task 6 – Advocacy practice

Based on the content explored in this module, write a 250–300-word persuasive essay to raise teenagers’ awareness of the importance of developing intercultural communication skills for their future success.

Draw on key concepts from the module, such as the role of intercultural dialogue in addressing global challenges, the differences between low-context and high-context communication styles, and the impact of non-verbal communication across cultures, to support your argument.

In your essay, try to employ a variety of rhetorical devices to engage your audience effectively. These may include parallel structure, alliteration, rhyming, and other techniques like rhetorical questions. Ensure your tone is persuasive yet relatable, appealing to teenagers by highlighting how these skills can shape their personal, academic, and professional futures in a globalised world.

Language reminders

A. Parallel structure means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. For example:

Speak up for cultural inclusivity,

Stand up for justice, and embrace unity.

The above couplet is an example of parallel structure, because both lines begin with a phrasal verb followed by a prepositional phrase.

***

B. Alliterations is the repetition of the same sound at the start of a series of words in succession. For example, in this definition, the following words are alliterated:

same, sound, start, series and succession

***

C. Rhyming is a literary device where the ending sounds of words are similar or identical.

For example, university rhymes with diversity, because they both end with -ty. You may try your hand at writing a rhymed couplet:

Celebrate our cultural tapestry at every university,

Embrace the strength found in our rich diversity.
