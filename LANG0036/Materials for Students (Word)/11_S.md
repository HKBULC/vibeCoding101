Module 11: Marginalization in Education Access

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs):

By the end of the module, students should be able to

Analyse global gender inequalities in educational access and their implications using comparison and contrast language;

Identify structural barriers to women’s education in patriarchal cultures;

Discuss forms of resistance to promote equitable education access and critical thinking;

Present persuasive arguments for inclusive education access in patriarchal contexts in written advocacy.

## Gender divide in education – a global view

Task 1 - Understanding gender divide in education on the global scale

Reflect on personal experience and discuss the following questions with a partner:

Can education be a form of empowerment? Why or why not?

How does education — or the lack of it — affect a person’s future opportunities, especially for girls and young women?

Why do you think some girls around the world still struggle to access education, while boys in the same country do not face the same barriers?

Watch this OECD report and complete the sentences below using no more than three words (link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Oexo0jpstk?feature=oembed_).

New _________________________ which never appeared before are emerging in education.

Girls find it hard to apply _________________________.

Boys often _________________________ video gaming over homework.

Parents have lower _________________________ girls in maths careers.

Task 2 – Comparing and contrasting emerging trends of gender divide in education

Read the following transcript and pay attention to the highlighted language of comparison and contrast:

While many countries have made great progress in narrowing gender gaps in education, new ones are opening. Of the weakest students in the three core subjects PISA assesses: reading, mathematics, and science, six out of ten are boys. At the same time, girls struggle when they are asked to think like scientists and apply what they've learned at school. Boys do less homework than girls, play more video games, and rarely read in their spare time. Parents and teachers can help boys to improve their reading habits by giving them more choice in what they read, allowing them some time for video gaming but insisting that they do their homework too. Too many girls still lack confidence in their own abilities and mathematics, and parents are less likely to expect their daughters to pursue mathematics related careers. Parents and teachers can help to build girls’ confidence by encouraging them to solve problems independently. When girls and boys can fulfil their potential in school, they can contribute more to the economic growth and well-being of their societies later on.

Language point: Language of comparison and contrast

A. What is comparison/contrast language?

Comparison language highlights similarities between two or more things, while contrast language highlights differences. This language helps to analyse trends, identify disparities, and make arguments clearer, especially in discussions about inequalities like gender gaps in education.

B. Note the underlined comparison/contrast language used in the transcript:

While many countries have made great progress in narrowing gender gaps in education, new ones are opening.

Of the weakest students in the three core subjects PISA assesses: reading, mathematics, and science, six out of ten are boys.

At the same time, girls struggle when they are asked to think like scientists …

Boys do less homework than girls, play more video games, and rarely read in their spare time.

Parents and teachers can help boys to improve their reading habits by giving them more choice in what they read.

… parents are less likely to expect their daughters to pursue mathematics related careers.

C. Why it matters:

In academic writing and speaking, comparison/contrast language helps you present data effectively (e.g. in infographics, essays) and make persuasive arguments by showing disparities or similarities.

D. Tips for use:

“more…than” or “less…than”: compare quantities (e.g. “Boys read less than girls”)

“most” or “least”: identify extremes (e.g. “Girls are least confident in mathematics”)

Linking phrases like “whereas”: Contrast ideas (e.g. “Boys struggle in reading, whereas girls lack confidence in science”)

Be precise with comparisons to avoid overgeneralisation (e.g. specify “in mathematics” rather than “in school”)

Observe the 2 charts below. Fill in the gaps with language of comparison and contrast to describe the emerging trends of gender divide in education.

Chart 1:

This chart shows that in general boys are underperforming _________________________ girls. Qatar has the _________________________ of underperforming students, whereas Shanghai-China has the _________________________ of underperforming students.

Chart 2:

This chart shows that a ______________ of boys start to use a computer at a young age _____________ girls. _________________ gender gap can be observed in Jordan, at __________________%, ______________ there is _______________ significant gender gap in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Costa Rica or Japan.

Based on the previous examples, write about a trend shown in each of the 2 charts below and make comparisons between countries in 50 words.

Task 3 – Gender equality in education in infographics

Study the poster about gender gaps in education published by OECD. How will you describe the new gender gaps that have emerged in global education? Write up your description in 150-200 words.

## MARGINALIZATION OF WOMEN IN EDUCTION IN patriarchal CULTURES

Major progress in educational access has been made globally. In 2018, the global adult literacy rate (aged 15 years and older) was 86 per cent, while the youth literacy rate (15 to 24 years) was 92 per cent. However, some 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in terms of reading and writing skills. These disadvantages in education also translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market for young women. This means women continue to be marginalized in their access to education in some countries, likely due to the patriarchal tradition of these countries.

Task 4 – Case study: Gender-based marginalization in education access in Pakistan

Read the excerpt from Women empowerment, and access to education in Pakistan: Barriers within home (Muneer, 2021) and answer the questions that follow:

Task 5 – Online learning as the last resort for Afghan girls’ education

Watch this SCMP report: Afghan girls turn to online classes amid higher education ban as schools start new academic year and discuss the topics below (link: https://youtu.be/RFbvdG-6IvE):

What are the long-term effects on society when girls are denied access to education, as in Afghanistan?

How effective do you think online education is as a solution for girls who cannot attend school or university?

What role should individuals play in ensuring equal education access for girls in countries with restrictive policies?

In what ways can international NGOs or local communities support girls’ education in challenging environments like Afghanistan?

Task 6 – Advocate for education access for Afghan girls

Imagine you are a young Afghan woman migrated to Hong Kong, currently studying in HKBU. An NGO at which you are volunteering is organising an essay writing competition, aiming at advocating for education access for Afghan girls. You are interested in submitting an entry, as you believe this would raise public awareness of the issue.

Read the prompt below and write an essay of 250-300 words in response to it:

Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, Afghan girls have been denied access to university education, severely limiting their opportunities. In your essay, discuss the challenges this creates for girls and suggest solutions to ensure they can continue their education. You should also invite your readers to show support for Afghan girls and anyone who suffers due to this policy in Afghanistan.

You may use the following table to brainstorm and plan your writing:
