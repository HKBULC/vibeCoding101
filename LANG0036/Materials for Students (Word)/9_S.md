Transcript

Hi, I’m Bernice Chan with SCMP.TV, and today we’re working with Food Angel to collect food from Global Fine Foods to take to Food Angel’s processing plant in Sham Shui Po.

Now we’re at Food Angel’s food kitchen, where they’re preparing the actual meals. CEO Caribbean Chan is going to take us on a tour, but first, we’ve got to put on our hairnets. Let’s go — let me show you around.

That’s a lot of vegetables! Yes, we have a lot because every day we collect four tonnes of food, and most of them are vegetables. We get them from supermarkets, hotels, or wet markets — basically everywhere. How many volunteers do you have for the everyday job? Every day, every kitchen, we need up to 20 to 30 volunteers per shift in each kitchen. You can see how busy it is!

Now we’re at Food Angel’s Community Centre, where they’re going to serve food to some of the elderly in a few minutes. Caribbean, how many people usually show up each day? We serve lunch and dinner, and for each session, we have around 100 people coming in. Wow, 100 people! Yes, they come in for both lunch and dinner. From what I can see, a lot of them are women, right? Yes. So, where are the men? One reason is that women live longer. Also, for men, perhaps it’s about dignity —they don’t want to let people know they’re in need or require help. That’s one reason why most of our beneficiaries are women.

Task 3 – Infographic presentations of statistical data

The image below is an infographic showing data on poverty and food access challenges in Hong Kong in 2021, based on a report by Feeding Hong Kong. Summarise the information in the infographic in 150-200 words by selecting and reporting the main findings, and make comparisons where relevant.

Task 4 – Uncovering the impact of discrimination and inequality on food access

What does discrimination have to do with food access? Let’s reflect on it and discuss the issue in groups.

Part 1: General Questions (4-5 minutes)
Reflect on the following questions about food access in your daily life. After that, speak to your groupmates for 1-2 minutes per question, providing examples where possible.

How easy is it for you to access fresh and nutritious food in your area?

Have you noticed any differences in food access between different communities in your city (e.g., Hong Kong)?

Do you think everyone in your country has equal access to food? Why or why not?

Part 2: Individual Long Turn (3-4 minutes)
You will have 1 minute to prepare your response to the following prompt, then speak for 1-2 minutes on the topic below. Use the prompts to guide your answer, and try to speak continuously without long pauses.

Describe a situation where discrimination or inequality affects food access in a community you know about.

You should say:

Where this situation occurs (e.g. in Hong Kong or another place)

What type of discrimination or inequality is involved (e.g. income inequality, lack of grocery stores, or challenges for people with disabilities)

How this impacts the community’s ability to access food

What you think could be done to improve the situation

Part 3: Group discussion (8 minutes)
Discuss the following questions among your group, providing detailed responses and examples. These questions require you to analyse the broader implications of discrimination and inequality in food access.

Why do you think some neighbourhoods in cities like Hong Kong become food deserts, with limited access to grocery stores?

How does income inequality affect people’s ability to afford nutritious food, and what can governments do to address this issue?

In what ways can global systems, such as trade or food distribution networks, contribute to unequal food access?

What challenges do individuals with disabilities face in accessing food, and how can society better support them?

Do you think food access should be considered a basic human right? Why or why not?

## 2. ADVOCATING FOR FOOD EQUITY

Task 6 – Why Equitable Food Access Matters in 2021 and Beyond

Why food access equality matters: https://youtu.be/ePVrcz9XzEc?si=WBHFYF07VmQefi_Z

You will watch a video about food equity issues and efforts to address them, featuring Pam Koch, an academic from Columbia University, and Tony Hillery, the Founder and Executive Director of Harlem Grown. Answer questions 1-10 below.

Transcript

We have learned this year that our food supply is fragile. Those images of empty shelves in grocery stores from March and April 2020 are burned into our memory. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a serious breakdown in the steps involved in getting food from plants and animals on farms to our grocery stores. At the same time, we saw the number of people who lacked resources to get food soar. The response was swift. The government responded in many ways, one of which was to make school meals grab-and-go and open to everyone, both children and adults. This worked to quickly get meals to people precisely because there are schools in all communities. This was all put into place when we did not know how to be safe from COVID-19 and cases were rapidly rising. Why did we have this massive and rapid response? Because everyone needs to eat each and every day. We cannot take a break from eating just because there is an emergency. We need a food safety net to ensure everyone can eat every day, no matter what.

Food inequity is not new. Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a big problem with inequitable access to food. BIPOC communities—that is, communities with Black, Indigenous, and people of colour—have long encountered systemic racism that limits access to healthy food, such as fruits and vegetables. It is unconscionable that in a rich country like the United States, we would not make food access a basic human right. COVID-19 has shown us more clearly than ever that this is a collective responsibility, not about individual choices.

Thankfully, there are already many people working hard to alleviate food accessibility issues, especially in New York. Tony Hillery is the Founder and Executive Director of Harlem Grown, a community initiative addressing these challenges.

It’s not a conscious decision not to feed your family healthy, organic food—everyone wants to, but how do you? I see this time and time again, and I honestly say in all of my talks that I’m as guilty as most because I too thought it was their problem. This is what people want to do, but look at the landscape of these communities. There’s a bodega on every corner, and there’s fast food. Where are the supermarkets with affordable produce? They’re non-existent. People in these communities don’t have cars, so how do you access these locations where you can purchase this stuff? It’s not a simple solution.

Over these years, I think that education breaks that cycle. With our kids, children are relentless, as everyone knows—they wear parents down for new shoes or other things. We want to wear them down for healthier food options, and you do that by educating the children. But then we’re right back where we started: where do you purchase it? That’s why we have 13 farms in Harlem, and we grow about six thousand pounds of produce, and everything is free. We give it out with cooking demos, nutrition education, and simple recipes that people can make at home. Saturday is our big program, and on Monday, we get calls from parents asking, ‘Where do I get chickpeas?’ or ‘Where do I get this?’ This is what we’re trying to do—trying to create the demand from the bottom up. We have spoken to the managers of all the supermarkets, and they’re businessmen. They will carry fresh, organic produce if they can sell it—they’re not going to get it to throw it away in three days. But if you have 100 people coming in and asking for some healthy chard or kale, they will carry it.

Prior to COVID, it was always ‘those people’—it was their problem, those children. COVID made it our problem, our kids. People who’ve never been food insecure in their life find themselves on food lines. So let’s stop blaming and pointing and putting it on ‘those people,’ because ‘those people’ are us—we are those people. No matter your skin colour, income, or zip code, everyone needs to have easy and convenient ways to obtain food that is nourishing and culturally relevant. We also need to think about those who work in food jobs. We need food justice for all to be able to eat well. Food equity is just one thing that really matters. Everyone needs nourishing food to be healthy physically and emotionally, to learn, and to be their best selves.

Task 7 – Advocacy practice

Work in groups. Each group member writes a 20-word champion slogan to advocate for food equality. Begin with a rhetorical question, and end with a powerful answer. Make the question-and-answer rhyme. Then combine the questions and answers written by the group and read the slogans aloud.

Language reminder:

Comment everyday examples of rhetorical questions:

Why do these things always happen to me?

Are you kidding me?

Who cares?

A sample slogan has been done for you:

How can we ensure children, women, and elders are fed?
By granting all equal access to daily bread.

Now write your own slogan:

How can we ____________________________________________?
By ____________________________________________________________________.

| Food access programs provide temporary relief for people experiencing food insecurity but fail to address underlying structural issues or empower communities with the tools to develop and implement their own solutions.
The US government offers assistance to families experiencing food insecurity through a variety of programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for low-income families and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Some studies have shown that participating in both programs can provide greater food access security. However, nutrition benefits are not available at all food retail locations, and restrictions on what types of food can be purchased via SNAP (the largest food assistance program in the US) limits recipients’ choices and control over their diets. Other issues with the programs include their failure to account for disparities in food cost among different geographical areas, or the differing nutritional requirements of family members of different ages, as well as their requirement that eligible recipients perform paid or unpaid work for their state in exchange for SNAP benefits. Recipients also face social stigma when using these programs, an additional burden on individuals experiencing food insecurity.
Food banks and community food pantries represent regional food access interventions intended to further assist vulnerable families and individuals. However, they are frequently overburdened and under-resourced in the face of local needs. Food banks and pantries also often depend on local food donations and, therefore, may not offer the most nutritious foods to recipients nor an abundance of culturally appropriate food choices. In recent years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing levels of food access difficulties among the US population, food banks have come under intense pressure to source more food for larger numbers of people in need. Rising food costs and supply chain disruptions put further strain on food banks and pantries to meet the growing demand. |
