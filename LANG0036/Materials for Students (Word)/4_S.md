MODULE 4: CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT

Figure 1: How polar bears are struggling to adapt to climate change

## Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs):

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

Understand core concepts of climate change and its environmental impacts;

Analyse the causes and consequences of climate change on ecosystems and communities;

Discuss climate change strategies using implied language, commentary expressions and justified arguments;

Advocate for sustainable environmental practices with persuasive language.

## 1. CONCEPTS

Task 1 – Warm-up

Read and reflect on the following Instagram post and the short passage under it:

Figure 2: A starving polar bear

******

How do you feel after reading the above? Think about the following and discuss them with your friends:

What comes to your mind when you see a picture of polar bears struggling on melting ice?

What’s one thing you’ve learned about climate change that surprised you?

Have you ever experienced an extreme weather event, like a heatwave or flood?

Do you think people around you notice climate change effects?

## 2. Understanding Climate Change – Key Concepts

Task 2 – Comprehending theme-based words

Work in pairs. Match the concepts related to climate change with their definitions in the table below.

## 3. Climate Change, A Man-Made Disaster – Pace, Pause and Stress in Effective Speech Delivery

Task 3 – Watching a video

Watch “Climate change” – A short film and answer the questions below:

The text is the transcript of the video. Pay attention to the highlight words in bold print in the text and learn those expressions which will be useful for persuasive writing:

## 4. Communicating Impacts of Climate Change – Sentence Patterns and Rhetorical Devices

In persuasive discourse, cause and effect analysis in conditional clauses and emphatic structures, such as inversion, are often employed to convince the reader/listener.

Task 4 – Comparing sentence patterns and their communicative effects

Explain the difference in effect between the following sentences and their revised versions.

Conditionals

[Original]

If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.

[Revised]

If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world will be on the horizon.

Emphatic structure: inversion

Compare the two versions of Sentences A and B. Is there any difference in their effects?

A1	Not only are we piling in more and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but we are chopping down the forests of the earth and the forests themselves are the most efficient consumers of carbon dioxide.

A2	We are not only piling in more and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but we are chopping down the forests of the earth and the forests themselves are the most efficient consumers of carbon dioxide.

B1	Never can we sit back and wait for miracles to save us.

B2	We can never sit back and wait for miracles to save us.

Think about warning messages that you wish to send to fellow students about climate change (or any other undesirable realities). Use inversion to show emphasis.

Not only should we__________________________________________________ but we

should __________________________________________________________________.

Never can we _____________________________________________________________.

## 5. From Deteriorating Biodiversity TO PRESERVATION SOLUTIONS

Task 5 – Call to action

The follow text shows how the United Nation calls for action to combat climate change:

The underlined words form sentence patterns sending cause/effect warnings as a call to action:

…, with + n + v+ing and ...v+ing (detailing/elaborating);

The global temperature has already risen …, with glaciers melting and the sea level rising.

…, v+ing…., v+ing…., v+ing….

Impacts of climate change include xxx, displacing…, denying …, expanding…, stifling… and causing…

Doing… is __________________ to … and _________ making ____….

Taking urgent action ….is an imperative to….key to making…a reality.

Practice: Use the v+ing patterns to show results and use “… is imperative to...” to suggest solutions.

Hurricane Karina struck the southeastern United States in 2005, _____________ around 2000 people, ________________ 80,000 housing units, ______________ $160 billion in damage. Transforming and strengthening our system of preparedness and response is an imperative to _________________________________________________________.

## 6. Making A Difference As An Individual in sustainable food choices

Task 6 – Presenting data in a written text

We discussed how numerical data should be reported in the previous 2 units. Here is a quick summary of all the methods introduced:

On the next page, you can find two sets of materials, i.e. infographics and a chart, illustrating the cost of food using numerical data. Write a short passage to report the data using the suggested methods above, and compare your text with your partner’s to see which strategies are in common.

Figure 4: Greenhouse gas lifecycle assessment for common proteins and vegetables

(Notes: Emissions are measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents, kgCO2eq, which take into account not only carbon dioxide but also other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, by converting them to carbon dioxide equivalents with the same global warming potential.)

| The global temperature has already risen 1.1ºC above the pre-industrial level, with glaciers melting and the sea level rising. Impacts of climate change also include flooding and drought, displacing millions of people, sinking them into poverty and hunger, denying them access to basic services, such as health and education, expanding inequalities, stifling economic growth and even causing conflict. By 2030, an estimated 700 million people will be at risk of displacement by drought alone.

Taking urgent action to combat climate change and its devastating impacts is therefore an imperative to save lives and livelihood, and key to making the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Goals– the blueprint for a better future – a reality.
