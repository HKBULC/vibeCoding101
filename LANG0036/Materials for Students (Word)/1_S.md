## 1. CONCEPTS

Task 1 – Warm-up speaking:

Figure 2: Harper’s BAZAAR June 2021 edition (Left), Zara Fall2022 Studio collection (Centre), H&M #HMPride 2022 Campaign (Right)

Part A: Personal Questions

Questions:

What does the word “fashion” mean to you?

Do you enjoy following fashion trends? Why or why not?

How often do you buy new clothes?

Part B: Individual Comments

Describe a fashion trend you’ve followed or noticed. You should say:

What the trend was;

When and where you saw it;

Why you think it became popular;

And explain how you feel about it now.

## 2. Can we remain fashionable but become ethical?

Faced with increasing criticism for environmental impacts and rising demands for eco-friendly products, fast fashion brands have been trying to reform their business model and making commitments to sustainability. Zara launched its “Join Life” line in 2016, offering an ongoing collection of clothes made from sustainable materials and manufactured with less environmental footprint. H&M has been promoting its sustainable concepts through offering Conscious choice products and advocating a circular economy by Take Care campaign. Will these actions allow fast fashion consumers to remain fashionable but become ethical at the same time?

.

## 3. WHAT CAN WE DO TO ADVOCATE FOR A CHANGE?

A manifesto is a written document publicly declaring the position of its issuer. It advances a set of ideas, opinions, or views, or lays out a plan of action. Manifestos are generally written in the name of a group sharing a common perspective, ideology, or purpose rather than in the name of a single individual.

Task 3 – Evaluating the effectiveness of a manifesto

Read the manifesto (a public declaration of policy and aims) of Fashion Revolution and answer the questions. (Source: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/manifesto/)

1. You have noticed that although the manifesto uses simple sentences, it is impactful and persuasive. Analyze how the ideas in the first paragraph are structured to learn the organizational skill at the discourse level.

Structure of the first paragraph:

2. Read the manifesto again and answer the questions below based on the text.

Task 4 – Rhetoric in persuasion

Persuasive rhetoric is the use of language to convince people to fact or behave in a certain way. Read the following excerpt of an article and answer the questions that follow to learn how language is used to achieve the communicative purpose of persuasion.

1a. What linguistic feature can you notice in the first sentence of the first paragraph “We speak of fashion as if it was something minor… exploitation, destruction, waste, and inhumane actions”? What is it used for?

Linguistic feature:

Purpose:

1b. Write a short sentence using this feature to describe an aspect of fast fashion’s impact.

Example: “We view fast fashion as if it were sustainable, yet it devastates ecosystems daily.”

2. In the second paragraph, how do the writers compare “a package” with its “contents” in the first sentence? What do you think is the main message that the writers want to convey through this comparison, i.e. how does the first sentence relate to the second sentence of the second paragraph?

Task 5 – Fast Fashion and Its Impact: Final Discussion

We have talked about personal fashion preferences and trends. Now, let’s discuss the wider impact of fast fashion and what can be done about it.

You may consider the following questions and refer to the notes you took in Task 2 during the discussion:

1. In what ways does fast fashion affect the society, based on what you’ve learned?

2. How serious are the environmental consequences of clothing production?

3. What can individuals do to support ethical fashion practices?

In your preparation, you may refer to the transcript of Task 2 (provided on the next page) to familiarise yourself with the topic and relevant terminologies. You will also benefit from going through “MANIFESTO FOR A FASHION REVOLUTION” again in Task 3, as it contains many useful terminologies for you to describe fashion.

Transcript of Task 2

We’re constantly bombarded with media that puts pressure on us to buy newer and trendier clothes, just to throw them away when they’re no longer in style. An estimated 93 million tons go to landfill or are burned every year—that’s roughly about a garbage truckload of textiles going to landfill every second! Producing clothes also pollutes our water and churns out CO2. The fast fashion model pioneered by Zara means that brands are churning out double the amount of clothing per year as they did in the early 2000s. But companies say that’s about to change because we can now buy eco-friendly fast fashion and recycle our clothes when we don’t want them anymore! But can we believe them?

Inditex, Zara’s parent company, and H&M Group are two of the biggest fashion retailers in the world, and both have collections that claim to reduce the environmental impact of making clothes. Not only that, but the two fashion giants say they are making their entire brands more sustainable. Let’s take a look at these promises, starting with the materials.

Main materials at Zara and H&M, as well as worldwide, are polyester, which accounts for around 52% of total fibre production, and cotton, which is around 24%. PET is a different name for polyester and is the same type of plastic found in water bottles. Actually, 60% of PET production goes to textiles, and only 30% to water bottles. The material is produced from petroleum, and the process uses lots of energy, releases CO2, as well as acids and ammonia into the water supply. Recycled polyester uses up to 60% less energy than virgin material and can be made from textile scraps or plastic trash. But inconsistencies in the threads can make it require more dye, and experts say that polyester fabrics can shed 700,000 microplastic fibres with every wash, which end up in the ocean and also in our food.

Cotton doesn’t have these problems but is still a chemical- and water-intensive crop. According to the World-Wide Fund for Nature, it takes 20,000 litres of water to make one kilo of cotton, which is enough for one T-shirt and a pair of jeans. Also, around 11% of the world’s pesticides are used on cotton fields. So, is organic cotton better? Essentially, there’s a massive difference between organic cotton and regular cotton. Suki, a representative of Fashion Revolution, an organisation that advocates worldwide for transparency and sustainability in the fashion industry, says, “Organic cotton is, in the long term, much better for the farmer that grows it, the environment, and the soil that produces it. It’s less water-intensive and doesn’t require as much irrigation as such.”

We requested an interview with H&M about the sustainability of their products, but they declined. Over email, they said, “We are happy to say that by the end of this year, all cotton we use will come from sustainable sources.” Zara also responded only through email, saying, “In 2019, the Group [Inditex, Zara’s parent company] used over 38,000 tonnes of sustainable cotton in its clothing (up 105% from 2018).” But what does “sustainable” actually mean? There’s no standard definition, and it doesn’t equal organic. H&M says that sustainable cotton can also mean recycled cotton or cotton that uses fewer pesticides and GMOs. Zara portrays its cotton as sustainable but calls it “ecologically grown” instead of organic. It claims the cotton uses natural fertilisers and pesticides and is certified by the Organic Content Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard, which say they control for chemical and water use in the whole production process. Terms like “conscious” and “ecologically grown” are hard to fact-check and confusing for the consumer.

| MANIFESTO for a Fashion Revolution
We are Fashion Revolution. We are designers, producers, makers, workers and consumers. We are academics, writers, business leaders, brands, retailers, trade unions and policymakers. We are the industry and the public. We are world citizens. We are a movement and a community. We are you.
We love fashion. But we don’t want our clothes to exploit people or destroy our planet. We demand radical, revolutionary change.
This is our dream…
#1: Fashion provides dignified work, from conception to creation to catwalk. It does not enslave, endanger, exploit, overwork, harass, abuse or discriminate against anyone. Fashion liberates worker and wearer and empowers everyone to stand up for their rights.
#2: Fashion provides fair and equal pay. It enriches the livelihood of everyone working across the industry, from farm to shop floor. Fashion lifts people out of poverty, creates thriving societies and fulfils aspiration.
#3: Fashion gives people a voice, making it possible to speak up without fear, join together in unity without repression and negotiate for better conditions at work and across communities.
#4: Fashion respects culture and heritage. It fosters, celebrates and rewards skills and craftsmanship. It recognises creativity as its strongest asset. Fashion never appropriates without giving due credit or steals without permission. Fashion honours the artisan.
#5: Fashion stands for solidarity, inclusiveness and democracy, regardless of race, class, gender, age, shape or ability. It champions diversity as crucial for success.
#6: Fashion conserves and restores the environment. It does not deplete precious resources, degrade our soil, pollute our air and water or harm our health. Fashion protects the welfare of all living things and safeguards our diverse ecosystems.
#7: Fashion never unnecessarily destroys or discards but mindfully redesigns and recuperates in a circular way. Fashion is repaired, reused, recycled and upcycled. Our wardrobes and landfills do not overflow with clothes that are coveted but not cherished, bought but not kept.
#8: Fashion is transparent and accountable. Fashion embraces clarity and does not hide behind complexity nor rely upon trade secrets to derive value. Anyone, anywhere can find out how, where, by whom and under what conditions their clothing is made.
#9: Fashion measures success by more than just sales and profits. Fashion conserves and restores the environment and values people over growth and profit.
#10: Fashion lives to express, delight, reflect, protest, comfort, commiserate and share. Fashion never subjugates, denigrates, degrades, marginalises or compromises. Fashion celebrates life. |
