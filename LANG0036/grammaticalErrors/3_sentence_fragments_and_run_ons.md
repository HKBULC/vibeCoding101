# Sentence Fragments and Run-On Sentences

## What are Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons?

**Sentence Fragment:** An incomplete sentence that lacks a subject, verb, or complete thought.

**Run-On Sentence:** Two or more independent clauses joined incorrectly without proper punctuation or conjunctions.

Both errors disrupt the flow of academic writing and make arguments harder to follow.

## Common Errors from the Draft

### Error 1: Sentence Fragment
**Incorrect:** "So powerful, you know."

**Problem:** This is not a complete sentence. It lacks a subject and a complete verb structure. It's a fragment used for emphasis in casual speech but inappropriate for academic writing.

**Correct:** "This approach is powerful because it affects many people simultaneously."

---

### Error 2: Comma Splice (Type of Run-On)
**Incorrect:** "Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes."

**Problem:** These are three sentence fragments/incomplete thoughts presented as sentences. The ideas are disconnected and lack proper structure.

**Correct:** "Whether every small action counts remains uncertain, though the cumulative effect of many individual efforts could be significant."

---

### Error 3: Fragment Following Complete Sentence
**Incorrect:** "One person doing something. It not enough."

**Problem:** 
- First part is a fragment (no complete verb)
- Second part is missing the verb "is"

**Correct:** "One person's actions alone are not enough to address climate change."

---

### Error 4: Run-On with Missing Punctuation
**Incorrect:** "Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement."

**Problem:** Multiple short, choppy sentences that could be combined. The last phrase is a fragment.

**Correct:** "Because politicians want votes, they create policies that appeal to their constituents. Therefore, individual actions can push governments to implement broader reforms and potentially start large-scale movements."

---

### Error 5: Comma Splice
**Incorrect:** "Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big."

**Problem:** Two independent clauses connected improperly with just a comma and conjunction, missing necessary verb forms.

**Correct:** "Individual actions may seem small, but when many people participate, the collective impact becomes significant."

---

## Understanding Complete Sentences

### A Complete Sentence Must Have:

1. **A subject** (who or what the sentence is about)
2. **A predicate** (verb + information about the subject)
3. **A complete thought** (makes sense on its own)

**Examples:**

✅ "Climate change poses significant challenges."
- Subject: Climate change
- Verb: poses
- Complete thought: Yes

❌ "Because climate change poses significant challenges."
- Has subject and verb BUT not a complete thought (dependent clause)

---

## Types of Sentence Fragments

### Type 1: Missing Subject
❌ "Can reduce pollution significantly."
✅ "Governments can reduce pollution significantly."

### Type 2: Missing Verb
❌ "Individual actions contributing to change."
✅ "Individual actions contribute to change."

### Type 3: Dependent Clause Standing Alone
❌ "Because individual actions matter."
✅ "Because individual actions matter, everyone should participate."
✅ "Individual actions matter."

### Type 4: Phrase Fragments (No Subject or Verb)
❌ "Like turning off lights and recycling."
✅ "Simple actions, like turning off lights and recycling, can make a difference."

---

## Types of Run-On Sentences

### Type 1: Fused Sentence (No Punctuation)
❌ "Climate change is serious everyone should act."
✅ "Climate change is serious. Everyone should act."
✅ "Climate change is serious, so everyone should act."

### Type 2: Comma Splice (Only a Comma)
❌ "Individual actions are important, they create change."

**Fix Option 1 - Period:**
✅ "Individual actions are important. They create change."

**Fix Option 2 - Semicolon:**
✅ "Individual actions are important; they create change."

**Fix Option 3 - Comma + Coordinating Conjunction:**
✅ "Individual actions are important, and they create change."

**Fix Option 4 - Subordination:**
✅ "Individual actions are important because they create change."

## How to Avoid Sentence Fragments

### Strategy 1: Check for Subject + Verb + Complete Thought
Read each sentence in isolation. Ask:
- Who or what is this sentence about? (subject)
- What are they doing? (verb)
- Does this express a complete idea?

### Strategy 2: Watch for Dependent Clause Starters
These words create dependent clauses that cannot stand alone:
- because, although, while, when, if, since, unless, whereas, after, before

❌ "Although individual actions seem small."
✅ "Although individual actions seem small, they can create significant change."

### Strategy 3: Avoid Informal Fragments
In academic writing, avoid intentional fragments used for emphasis in casual speech:
- ❌ "Very important." → ✅ "This is very important."
- ❌ "Not really." → ✅ "This is not entirely accurate."

---

## How to Avoid Run-On Sentences

### Strategy 1: Identify Independent Clauses
An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

"Individual actions matter" = independent clause
"collective action is powerful" = independent clause

You cannot join them with just a comma:
❌ "Individual actions matter, collective action is powerful."

### Strategy 2: Use the FANBOYS Method
You can connect two independent clauses with a comma + coordinating conjunction:

**FANBOYS:** For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So

✅ "Individual actions matter, **and** collective action is powerful."
✅ "The problem is serious, **but** solutions exist."

### Strategy 3: Use Semicolons Appropriately
Semicolons can connect closely related independent clauses:

✅ "Individual actions matter; collective action is powerful."
✅ "The evidence is clear; action is necessary."

### Strategy 4: Create Separate Sentences
Sometimes the clearest solution is to use two sentences:

✅ "Individual actions matter. Collective action is powerful."

### Strategy 5: Use Subordination
Make one clause dependent on the other:

✅ "**Although** individual actions matter, collective action is more powerful."
✅ "Individual actions matter **because** they inspire collective change."

## Revision Checklist

### For Fragments:
✓ **Does each sentence have a subject?**
✓ **Does each sentence have a complete verb?**
✓ **Does each sentence express a complete thought?**
✓ **Have I avoided starting sentences with dependent clause markers without completing the thought?**
✓ **Have I eliminated informal fragments used for emphasis?**

### For Run-Ons:
✓ **Have I identified all independent clauses?**
✓ **Are independent clauses properly connected (period, semicolon, or comma + FANBOYS)?**
✓ **Have I avoided comma splices?**
✓ **Are my longer sentences clear and not overly complex?**

   - ✅ "Because governments have more power, they should take the lead."
   - ✅ "Governments have more power. They should take the lead."

3. ❌ "Many solutions available. Such as renewable energy and carbon taxes."
   - ✅ "Many solutions are available, such as renewable energy and carbon taxes."

### Fix the Run-Ons:

1. ❌ "Climate change is urgent we must act now."
   - ✅ "Climate change is urgent, so we must act now."
   - ✅ "Climate change is urgent. We must act now."

2. ❌ "Individual actions matter, governments must also participate."
   - ✅ "Individual actions matter, but governments must also participate."
   - ✅ "Individual actions matter; governments must also participate."

3. ❌ "People can recycle, they can use less energy, they can support green companies."
   - ✅ "People can recycle, use less energy, and support green companies."
   - ✅ "People can take several actions: recycling, using less energy, and supporting green companies."

## Academic Writing Tip

### Varying Sentence Structure

While avoiding fragments and run-ons, aim for sentence variety:

**Mix:**
- **Simple sentences:** "Climate change threatens our future."
- **Compound sentences:** "Individual actions are important, and collective efforts amplify their impact."
- **Complex sentences:** "Although individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, they create momentum for systemic reform."
- **Compound-complex sentences:** "While governments possess greater regulatory power, individual actions remain crucial because they shape consumer demand and influence political priorities."

This variety makes your writing more engaging while maintaining grammatical correctness.

### Common Academic Patterns

| Weak Version | Strong Academic Version |
|--------------|------------------------|
| "This is important. It helps." | "This approach is important because it helps address systemic issues." |
| "People do things, it works." | "When individuals take action, collective impact becomes measurable." |
| "So powerful." | "This demonstrates the considerable power of coordinated efforts." |

## Final Reminder

Sentence fragments and run-ons are among the most serious grammatical errors in academic writing. They:
- Confuse readers
- Weaken arguments
- Reduce credibility
- Lower grades

Always proofread specifically for complete, properly constructed sentences. Reading your work aloud can help identify these errors, as fragments and run-ons often sound awkward when spoken.
