# Subject-Verb Agreement Errors

## What is Subject-Verb Agreement?

Subject-verb agreement means that the subject and verb in a sentence must match in number. Singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.

## How to Avoid Subject-Verb Agreement Errors

### Strategy 1: Identify the Subject
Always locate the main subject of your sentence first. Ask yourself: "Who or what is performing the action?"

**Example:** In "The impact of individual actions **is** significant," the subject is "impact" (singular), not "actions."

### Strategy 2: Check for Singular vs. Plural
- **Singular subjects:** he, she, it, one person, the government, climate change
- **Plural subjects:** they, we, people, actions, governments, companies

### Strategy 3: Remember Common Patterns

| Subject Type | Present Tense Verb | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| I | am / verb | I am concerned / I think |
| He/She/It | is / verb+s | She is worried / It seems |
| We/You/They | are / verb | They are important / We believe |

### Strategy 4: Don't Let Prepositional Phrases Confuse You
The subject is never in a prepositional phrase.

**Incorrect:** "The effects of climate change is devastating."
**Correct:** "The effects of climate change are devastating."
(Subject is "effects," not "climate change")

## Academic Writing Tip

In formal academic writing, always use complete sentences with proper subject-verb agreement. Sentence fragments and missing verbs weaken your argument and reduce credibility. Take time to proofread specifically for this error, as it's one of the most common mistakes in academic writing.
