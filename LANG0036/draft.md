Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.
