Part 2: AI-assisted Review (10%)
After completing your point-of-view essay, you will use an AI tool to analyse and refine
your writing at various levels, e.g. paragraph structure, sentence construction, and
vocabulary naturalness. The goal of your collaboration with the AI tool is to identify
potential weaknesses and improve your essay.
You may follow these steps when conducting your AI-assisted Review:
1. AI Analysis:
● Input your essay into an AI tool and request feedback on aspects including but
not limited to: paragraph structure (e.g. coherence, flow), sentence
construction (e.g. grammar, variety), and vocabulary naturalness (e.g.
appropriateness, precision).
● Engage in an in-depth “conversation” with the AI tool with multiple meaningful
and relevant exchanges, asking follow-up questions to clarify suggestions.
2. Critical Review:
● Evaluate each recommendation critically, deciding which to implement based
on your understanding and the essay’s intent. Do not blindly accept all AI
suggestions.
● Treat this as an iterative process, not a one-off edit. Revise your essay multiple
times based on AI feedback and your critical analysis.
3. Revised Submission:
● Submit both the original and the revised versions of your essay to Turnitin.
● Save the full chat history to submit with your work as an appendix.
Due Date: Week 13 18:00 Sunday 30th Nov.
