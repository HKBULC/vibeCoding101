Enhancing English through Global Citizenship

LANG0036
3. OFFERING DEPARTMENT
Language Centre
4. AIMS & OBJECTIVES
Enhancing English through Global Citizenship (EEGC) is an English enhancement course
designed to develop students’ English language proficiency and learning skills in response
to pressing global themes according to UNESCO’s global citizenship education framework
(2015). Enhancing English focuses on the pragmatic demands of English in academic and
professional contexts, equipping students with the skills to engage critically with multimodal
texts and global issues. Using transformative ESL (English as a Second Language)
pedagogies, the course simultaneously enhances learners’ English communicative
competencies, critical thinking skills, and understanding of the complex challenges facing
humanity today. More importantly, it increases students’ willingness to make positive
changes.
This course equips students with academic discourse skills for analysing global issues
through listening and reading tasks. They will produce point-of-view writing, and deliver
persuasive speeches to advocate for positive changes. Artificial Intelligence tools will
support students in addressing specific language issues to ensure that they are able to manage
their studies in an English-medium university.

PILO 1 To develop advanced proficiency, literacy, and literary skills across
multiple languages;
PILO 2 To demonstrate interpersonal competency and cultural sensitivity that
meet the needs of the modern workplace;
PILO 3 To employ a variety of strategies for effective communication in
academic and professional settings;
PILO 4 To exhibit critical, reflective and adaptive skills essential for self-
regulated language learning;
PILO 5 To enhance communication strategies through technologies for effective
human-human and human-AI interaction across varied academic and
professional settings.
COURSE INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (CILOS)
The core pedagogical approach used in the course will be Kolb’s Experiential Learning
Cycle – Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and
Active Experimentation (Kolb, 2015). Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle integrates
reflection into each learning stage, actively engaging learners in the learning process and
encouraging practical application to their everyday lives. The following diagram (adapted
from APCEIU, 2020), illustrates how Kolb’s cycle can be implemented in this course.
Figure 1: Examples of learning activities based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle
CILO PILOs By the end of the course, students should be able to
CILO 1 1, 2, 3 Apply appropriate academic discourse skills to understand
global issues through listening and reading;
CILO 2 1, 2, 3 Apply critical thinking skills and structural features (e.g.,
thesis and supporting points) to produce point-of-view
writing;
CILO 3 1, 2, 3 Deliver advocacy speeches through multimodal means (e.g.,
posters, leaflets) to promote positive changes;
CILO 4 1, 4 Employ precise vocabulary and terminology to articulate
viewpoints on global issues;
CILO 5 4, 5 Use AI as a partner to enhance language proficiency

through independent learning
7. TEACHING & LEARNING ACTIVITIES (TLAs)
Brief descriptions of TLAs and the alignment with the CILOs in the following format:
Students will receive extensive opportunities to listen to, read and analyse authentic discourse
on global issues (such as research articles, YouTube videos by NGOs or experts, news or
government reports). Through following Kolb’s learning cycle in task-based pedagogy,
students will develop linguistic proficiency and persuasive skills while developing a critical
awareness of the world.
TLAs CILO
Listen to and read multimodal source materials on global 1, 2, 3
issues and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
arguments presented in these materials.
Write a structured point-of-view essay on a global issue. 1, 2, 3
Create multimodal materials and present them in an oral 1, 2, 3
advocacy presentation
Use academic vocabulary and terminology in in-class 1, 4
discussions, assignments, and independent learning
activities.
Use AI tools to enhance proficiency and accuracy at the 4, 5
paragraph, sentence, clause, and vocabulary levels.
8. ASSESSMENT METHODS (AMS)
AMs should be aligned with the appropriate CILOs to ensure that there is sufficient evidence to
show that students have achieved the CILOs at the end of the course. (This alignment with the
CILOs is crucial as documented evidence where the required competency of all the CILOs is
assessed.)
