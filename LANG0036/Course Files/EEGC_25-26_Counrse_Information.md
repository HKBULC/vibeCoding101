Please refer to EEGC (25-26) Assessment Guidelines available on ALL Sections Moodle for details.
This course is a non-credit bearing course. Students will be awarded with a letter grade of “S”
(Satisfactory) or “F” (Fail), which will be shown on the students’ academic transcript. Students who COURSE
obtain 50% and above will receive an S grade. This course is a prerequisite for UCLC1008 University GRADE
English I.
Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. If absence is due to circumstances beyond
their control, to apply for make-up work (e.g. papers, assignments), a written explanation together
ATTENDANCE with supporting documents must be presented to the course instructor for approval within FIVE
POLICY calendar days after the absence (e.g., your written explanation and the document should be
submitted to the course instructor on or before Saturday if you are absent on Monday).
Late submissions of assignments will incur a penalty—one percent will be deducted for each day
past the deadline (weekends and statutory holidays included). For example, if your Multimodal
Advocacy project is initially awarded 8% (out of 10%) and is two days late, then the final score for
this assignment will be: 8% - 2% = 6%. If you have a valid reason for late submission, you should
discuss it with your lecturer prior to the assignment due date.
LATE
Students must take all assessment tests and submit all assignments. MAKE-UP tests (including in- SUBMISSION
class assessments such as Listening/Reading Tests, In-class Point-of-view Writing) will be allowed
only upon presentation of a valid medical or official leave certificate within FIVE calendar days
from the test date. (e.g., the supporting document should be submitted to the course instructor
on or before Saturday if the test is scheduled for Monday).

Plagiarism (i.e. copying from other sources without an acknowledgement or copying other
students’ work) is NOT tolerated at HKBU.
You are required to cite the sources using in-text citations and include an end-of-text reference list
when incorporating some evidence or ideas from others (e.g. websites, online dictionary,
PLAGIARISM
newspaper article) into your assignments. You can refer to APA 7th Citation Guide for proper

In alignment with the Language Centre's policy on AI-based services, which emphasizes
ethical, responsible, and transparent use of generative AI tools, this course (LANG0036
Enhancing English through Global Citizenship) integrates AI to foster human-AI
collaboration as a key learning outcome. Students are encouraged to leverage AI tools to
enhance writing skills, such as through iterative feedback on paragraph structure, sentence
variety, and vocabulary in the AI-assisted review component of the writing assessment.
Similarly, AI can aid in designing multimodal advocacy projects, including generating visuals,
refining narratives, or exploring creative elements for videos or posters. Students must
USE OF AI TOOLS
declare AI usage where applicable, citing tools per guidelines, and critically evaluate
IN
suggestions to avoid over-reliance.
ASSESSMENT

tests, pre-course video, and critical dialogues— must be completed without any digital
assistance to ensure authentic demonstration of individual skills.
