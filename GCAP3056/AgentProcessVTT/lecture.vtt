00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:10.110
classroom: Alright, so, I think, we're gonna wait for a few more minutes. Maybe a few more students will join us, because I've got…

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.870
classroom: 25 students enrolled in this course, have a full house. I don't know how many will show up. So while we're waiting, I'd like to, share with you a letter

3
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.310
classroom: That was published.

4
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.539
classroom: Let me check.

5
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009
classroom: 2021! That was when you were…

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:48.490
classroom: Still in the high school, right? 2021. Yeah, I, you know, these days, I keep, showing people the article I wrote many years ago. Like, this one is, like, 4 years ago. Anyway,

7
00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:02.339
classroom: if you look at… because I know many of you are from Chinese medicine, right? Raise your hand if you're from Chinese medicine. Yeah, okay. So we have a special session for Chinese medicine. So that's why I show this letter to you.

8
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.840
classroom: The title is How Hong Kong Can Apply Traditional Chinese Medicine in Fight Against Chronic Disease.

9
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:21.519
classroom: And you can see there's some summary line here. The health department strategy focusing on specific risk factors rather than holistic health management.

10
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:37.159
classroom: the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are able to customize health recommendations to individual constitutions and needs. So that's a very classical point about the difference between the Chinese medicine and the Western medicine, right? Because

11
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:48.000
classroom: the Chinese citizens take a more holistic, approach. And also, you know, take into consideration the individualized, individual constitution. So.

12
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.549
classroom: This letter…

13
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.570
classroom: Another reason why I want to show you this letter is because it was the collaboration between me and,

14
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.289
classroom: a PhD student in Chinese medicine from BU, okay? So,

15
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
classroom: I think this is a very good way to introduce this course.

16
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.400
classroom: Because one thing we do in this course is to write about public policy.

17
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.380
classroom: And then try to publish in South China Morning Post.

18
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.539
classroom: Okay, so Sunshine Money Post has got a letter section.

19
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.049
classroom: letter to the editor, okay? Anyone can submit.

20
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.049
classroom: Anyone can submit a letter.

21
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.970
classroom: It's, you won't get paid.

22
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.330
classroom: Alright? But, if you, if the editor liked the letter, they will run it, they will publish it on paper, okay, as well as online.

23
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.200
classroom: So, the…

24
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:57.369
classroom: the word limit is up to 400 words, alright? Up to 400 words. But usually, these days, you see the whole section is kind of getting smaller, not enough space, so it's getting harder to publish letters there.

25
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:08.539
classroom: And, you know, when I first, offered this course, it was back in 20… 2019 or something?

26
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.269
classroom: I got at least 10 or more letters published every semester.

27
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.740
classroom: My students.

28
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.410
classroom: Okay? But these days, it's getting, getting more difficult, and also…

29
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:35.600
classroom: I don't always get the time to supervise and help students to pursue the project very rigorously, so we get less… fewer letters published these days. But still, we manage to publish at least 4 or 5 each semester.

30
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.770
classroom: Okay?

31
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.560
classroom: And, another thing is, the number of co-authors can be up to 3.

32
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.009
classroom: Okay? So,

33
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.220
classroom: But of course, if you form a group, let's say we have a group of 4 or 5,

34
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.760
classroom: Then you have to decide, you know, who is going to be the co-author.

35
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.700
classroom: Right? Or you can try to write two letters.

36
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.980
classroom: Alright.
