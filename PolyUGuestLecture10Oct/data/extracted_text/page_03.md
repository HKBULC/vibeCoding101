paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with the first objective mentioning the various
important terminologies of NLP and NLG. Section 3 deals with the history of NLP, applica-
tions of NLP and a walkthrough of the recent developments. Datasets used in NLP and various
approaches are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 is written on evaluation metrics and
challenges involved in NLP. Finally, a conclusion is presented in Section 6.


2 Components of NLP

NLP can be classified into two parts i.e., Natural Language Understanding and Natural
Language Generation which evolves the task to understand and generate the text. Figure 1
presents the broad classification of NLP. The objective of this section is to discuss the Natural
Language Understanding (Linguistic) (NLU) and the Natural Language Generation (NLG).

2.1 NLU

NLU enables machines to understand natural language and analyze it by extracting concepts,
entities, emotion, keywords etc. It is used in customer care applications to understand the
problems reported by customers either verbally or in writing. Linguistics is the science which
involves the meaning of language, language context and various forms of the language. So, it
is important to understand various important terminologies of NLP and different levels of
NLP. We next discuss some of the commonly used terminologies in different levels of NLP.

a) Phonology

Phonology is the part of Linguistics which refers to the systematic arrangement of sound. The
term phonology comes from Ancient Greek in which the term phono means voice or sound
and the suffix –logy refers to word or speech. In 1993 Nikolai Trubetzkoy stated that
