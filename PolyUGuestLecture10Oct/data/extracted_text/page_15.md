down, so an ability to summarize the data while keeping the meaning intact is highly
required. This is important not just allowing us the ability to recognize the understand
the important information for a large set of data, it is used to understand the deeper
emotional meanings; For example, a company determines the general sentiment on social
media and uses it on their latest product offering. This application is useful as a valuable
marketing asset.
    The types of text summarization depends on the basis of the number of documents and the
two important categories are single document summarization and multi document summari-
zation (Zajic et al. 2008 [159]; Fattah and Ren 2009 [43]).Summaries can also be of two types:
generic or query-focused (Gong and Liu 2001 [50]; Dunlavy et al. 2007 [37]; Wan 2008 [144];
Ouyang et al. 2011 [99]).Summarization task can be either supervised or unsupervised (Mani
and Maybury 1999 [74]; Fattah and Ren 2009 [43]; Riedhammer et al. 2010 [110]). Training
data is required in a supervised system for selecting relevant material from the documents.
Large amount of annotated data is needed for learning techniques. Few techniques are as
follows–

–    Bayesian Sentence based Topic Model (BSTM) uses both term-sentences and term
     document associations for summarizing multiple documents. (Wang et al. 2009 [146])
–    Factorization with Given Bases (FGB) is a language model where sentence bases are the
     given bases and it utilizes document-term and sentence term matrices. This approach
     groups and summarizes the documents simultaneously. (Wang et al. 2011) [147])
–    Topic Aspect-Oriented Summarization (TAOS) is based on topic factors. These topic
     factors are various features that describe topics such as capital words are used to represent
     entity. Various topics can have various aspects and various preferences of features are
     used to represent various aspects. (Fang et al. 2015 [42])

f) Dialogue System

Dialogue systems are very prominent in real world applications ranging from providing
support to performing a particular action. In case of support dialogue systems, context
awareness is required whereas in case to perform an action, it doesn’t require much context
awareness. Earlier dialogue systems were focused on small applications such as home theater
systems. These dialogue systems utilize phonemic and lexical levels of language. Habitable
dialogue systems offer potential for fully automated dialog systems by utilizing all levels of a
language. (Liddy, 2001) [68].This leads to producing systems that can enable robots to interact
with humans in natural languages such as Google’s assistant, Windows Cortana, Apple’s Siri
and Amazon’s Alexa etc.

g) Medicine

NLP is applied in the field as well. The Linguistic String Project-Medical Language Processor
is one the large scale projects of NLP in the field of medicine [21, 53, 57, 71, 114]. The LSP-
MLP helps enabling physicians to extract and summarize information of any signs or
symptoms, drug dosage and response data with the aim of identifying possible side effects
of any medicine while highlighting or flagging data items [114]. The National Library of
Medicine is developing The Specialist System [78–80, 82, 84]. It is expected to function as an
Information Extraction tool for Biomedical Knowledge Bases, particularly Medline abstracts.
