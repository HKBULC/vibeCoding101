that even though a great amount of work on natural language processing is available in
literature surveys (one may refer to [15, 32, 63, 98, 133, 151] focusing on one domain such
as usage of deep-learning techniques in NLP, techniques used for email spam filtering,
medication safety, management research, intrusion detection, and Gujarati language etc.), still
there is not much work on regional languages, which can be the focus of future research.
