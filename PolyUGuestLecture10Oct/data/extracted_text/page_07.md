   Ambiguity is one of the major problems of natural language which occurs when one
sentence can lead to different interpretations. This is usually faced in syntactic, semantic,
and lexical levels. In case of syntactic level ambiguity, one sentence can be parsed into
multiple syntactical forms. Semantic ambiguity occurs when the meaning of words can be
misinterpreted. Lexical level ambiguity refers to ambiguity of a single word that can have
multiple assertions. Each of these levels can produce ambiguities that can be solved by the
knowledge of the complete sentence. The ambiguity can be solved by various methods such as
Minimizing Ambiguity, Preserving Ambiguity, Interactive Disambiguation and Weighting
Ambiguity [125]. Some of the methods proposed by researchers to remove ambiguity is
preserving ambiguity, e.g. (Shemtov 1997; Emele & Dorna 1998; Knight & Langkilde
2000; Tong Gao et al. 2015, Umber & Bajwa 2011) [39, 46, 65, 125, 139]. Their objectives
are closely in line with removal or minimizing ambiguity. They cover a wide range of
ambiguities and there is a statistical element implicit in their approach.

2.2 NLG

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the process of producing phrases, sentences and
paragraphs that are meaningful from an internal representation. It is a part of Natural Language
Processing and happens in four phases: identifying the goals, planning on how goals may be
achieved by evaluating the situation and available communicative sources and realizing the
plans as a text (Fig. 2). It is opposite to Understanding.

a) Speaker and Generator


   To generate a text, we need to have a speaker or an application and a generator or a program
that renders the application’s intentions into a fluent phrase relevant to the situation.
