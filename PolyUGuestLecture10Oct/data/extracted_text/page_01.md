Abstract
Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained much attention for representing
and analyzing human language computationally. It has spread its applications in various
fields such as machine translation, email spam detection, information extraction, summa-
rization, medical, and question answering etc. In this paper, we first distinguish four
phases by discussing different levels of NLP and components of Natural Language
Generation followed by presenting the history and evolution of NLP. We then discuss
in detail the state of the art presenting the various applications of NLP, current trends, and
challenges. Finally, we present a discussion on some available datasets, models, and
evaluation metrics in NLP.

Keywords Natural language processing . Natural language understanding . Natural language
generation . NLP applications . NLP evaluation metrics
