Russian, Japanese, Arabic, Korean and Mandarin Chinese. The Pilot earpiece is connected via
Bluetooth to the Pilot speech translation app, which uses speech recognition, machine
translation and machine learning and speech synthesis technology. Simultaneously, the
user will hear the translated version of the speech on the second earpiece. Moreover, it is
not necessary that conversation would be taking place between two people; only the
users can join in and discuss as a group. As if now the user may experience a few second
lag interpolated the speech and translation, which Waverly Labs pursue to reduce. The
Pilot earpiece will be available from September but can be pre-ordered now for $249.
The earpieces can also be used for streaming music, answering voice calls, and getting
audio notifications.

4 Datasets in NLP and state-of-the-art models

The objective of this section is to present the various datasets used in NLP and some state-of-
the-art models in NLP.

4.1 Datasets in NLP

Corpus is a collection of linguistic data, either compiled from written texts or transcribed from
recorded speech. Corpora are intended primarily for testing linguistic hypotheses - e.g., to
determine how a certain sound, word, or syntactic construction is used across a culture or
language. There are various types of corpus: In an annotated corpus, the implicit information in
the plain text has been made explicit by specific annotations. Un-annotated corpus contains
raw state of plain text. Different languages can be compared using a reference corpus. Monitor
corpora are non-finite collections of texts which are mostly used in lexicography. Multilingual
corpus refers to a type of corpus that contains small collections of monolingual corpora
based on the same sampling procedure and categories for different languages. Parallel
corpus contains texts in one language and their translations into other languages which
are aligned sentence phrase by phrase. Reference corpus contains text of spoken (formal
and informal) and written (formal and informal) language which represents various social
and situational contexts. Speech corpus contains recorded speech and transcriptions of
recording and the time each word occurred in the recorded speech. There are various
datasets available for natural language processing; some of these are listed below for
different use cases:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis is a rapidly expanding field of natural language
   processing (NLP) used in a variety of fields such as politics, business etc. Majorly used
   datasets for sentiment analysis are:

a) Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST): Socher et al. introduced SST containing sentiment
   labels for 215,154 phrases in parse trees for 11,855 sentences from movie reviews posing
   novel sentiment compositional difficulties [127].
b) Sentiment140: It contains 1.6 million tweets annotated with negative, neutral and positive
   labels.
