please read /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/output/paperFull.md and look for specific NLP technologies that could be implemented in python

the paper may not mention any such implementation

you need to decide whether it can be implemented

generate a CSV file to name the tech, define the input, process and output and a brief note on how to to implement

do not write any python
just read the paper directly

ok I also need a column to include some excerpt from the original paper for each row


now for each row please search github to find repos that can implement 

find up to 3 repos for each row and indicate the number of stars they receive
