We have a group of master students on Gen AI and language education. We'll demonstrate basic vibe coding. It is not a hands-on workshop as the speaker only has one hour. 

we need to prepare a few slides- bullet points to talk about the basics of AI 

maybe we can ask Python to generate a PPT or edit Google slides 

the basic idea is that we should move away from talking to AI via browser mainly because it is very costly to switch contexts 

to leverage AI agent we can now bring AI to our working context, the folders where we keep and update different files  

we'll use 

then we'll 

take this review article as the starting point and explore how AI agent can help us work with this paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-022-13428-4


let's do a simple test first 

can AI agent read the whole paper that is publicly accessible online 

it turns out that the paper is behind the paywall but it is accessible via library subscription 

but still /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/Khurana et al 2022-preview.md this is what agent gave us - which is pretty amazing 

we can also see the chat history /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/chat_access_URLpreview.md


ok let's download the PDF
