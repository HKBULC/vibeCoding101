## Technical Implementations Demonstrated

### 1. Python Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

### 2. QR Code Generation
```python
import qrcode
from PIL import Image
import os

def generate_qr_code(url, filename):
    qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, box_size=10, border=5)
    qr.add_data(url)
    qr.make(fit=True)
    img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
    img.save(filename)
```

### 3. Web Search and Validation
```bash
# URL validation
curl -I https://example.com | head -3

# Content fetching
curl -s -A "Mozilla/5.0..." https://example.com | head -1000
```

### 4. Academic Database Access
```bash
# ERIC database search
curl -I "https://eric.ed.gov/?q=generative+artificial+intelligence+university+students"

# ArXiv API access
curl -s "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=..."
```

### 5. VS Code Extension Integration
```bash
# List installed extensions
code --list-extensions --show-versions | grep -i scholar

# Extension file analysis
cat "/home/codespace/.vscode-remote/extensions/adupa-nithin-sai.search-google-scholar-1.0.1/extension.js"
```
