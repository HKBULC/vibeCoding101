overall ther result is good 

yet there are some headings missing e.g 3 NLP then and now 

also under some section like 2.1 there are sub-sections like

 a) phonology ...

b) Morphology 

please write more python scripts to convert /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/data/s11042-022-13428-4.pdf into an MD and place it here /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/output/paperFull.md


all python scripts generated should be placed here /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/Scripts do not delete

we should then revise /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/OneDriveCursor/vibeCoding101/vibeCoding101/PolyUGuestLecture10Oct/output/paperMetaData.md
